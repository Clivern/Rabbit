Rabbit is a lightweight service that will build and store your go projects binaries. Once a VCS system (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket or Bitbucket Server) notifies rabbit of a new release, it clones the project, builds different binaries and publishes them.

## Documentation

### Development:

Rabbit uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies. First Create a prod config file.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Clivern/Rabbit.git
$ cp config.dist.yml config.prod.yml
```

Then add your default configs. You probably wondering how the following configs even work! let's pick one and explain.

The item `mode: ${RABBIT_APP_MODE:-dev}` means that the mode is dev unless environment variable `RABBIT_APP_MODE` is defined. so you can always override the value by defining the environment variable `export RABBIT_APP_MODE=prod`. and same for others

```yml
# General App Configs
app:
    # Env mode (dev or prod)
    mode: ${RABBIT_APP_MODE:-dev}
    # HTTP port
    port: ${RABBIT_APP_PORT:-8080}
    # App URL
    domain: ${RABBIT_APP_DOMAIN:-http://127.0.0.1:8080}
    # TLS configs
    tls:
        status: ${RABBIT_APP_TLS_STATUS:-off}
        pemPath: ${RABBIT_APP_TLS_PEMPATH:-cert/server.pem}
        keyPath: ${RABBIT_APP_TLS_KEYPATH:-cert/server.key}

        ssh_format: ${RABBIT_INTEGRATION_BITBUCKET_SSH_FORMAT:-git@bitbucket.org:[.RepoFullName].git}
    bitbucket_server:

        https_format: ${RABBIT_INTEGRATION_BITBUCKET_SERVER_HTTPS_FORMAT:-https://git.bitbucket.com/scm/[.RepoFullName].git}
        # SSH URL format, Full name will be something like Clivern/Rabbit
        ssh_format: ${RABBIT_INTEGRATION_BITBUCKET_SERVER_SSH_FORMAT:-ssh://git@git.bitbucket.com/[.RepoFullName].git}
    gitlab:
        # Webhook URI (Full URL will be app.domain + webhook_uri)
        webhook_uri: ${RABBIT_INTEGRATION_GITLAB_WEBHOOK_URI:-/webhook/gitlab}
        # Webhook Secret (From Repo settings page > Webhooks)
        webhook_secret: ${RABBIT_INTEGRATION_GITLAB_WEBHOOK_SECRET:- }
        # whether to use ssh or https to clone
        clone_with: ${RABBIT_INTEGRATION_GITLAB_CLONE_WITH:-https}
        # HTTPS URL format, Full name will be something like Clivern/Rabbit
        https_format: ${RABBIT_INTEGRATION_GITLAB_HTTPS_FORMAT:-https://gitlab.com/[.RepoFullName].git}
        # SSH URL format, Full name will be something like Clivern/Rabbit
        ssh_format: ${RABBIT_INTEGRATION_GITLAB_SSH_FORMAT:-git@gitlab.com:[.RepoFullName].git}
```

And then run the application.

```bash
$ go build rabbit.go
$ ./rabbit

// OR

$ go run rabbit.go

// To Provide a custom config file
$ ./rabbit -config=/custom/path/config.prod.yml
$ go run rabbit.go -config=/custom/path/config.prod.yml
```

## Deployment

Rabbit needs a decent resources to be able to work properly because the build process itself done by goreleaser and it consumes a lot. So keep `build.parallelism` equal `1` and increase if you have more resources and would like to speed the build process.

### On a Linux Server

Make sure you have `git`, `golang 1.12` and `goreleaser` installed, and make goreleaser executable from everywhere.

```bash
# To download the latest goreleaser binary for linux (https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases)
$ curl -sL https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/download/v0.116.0/goreleaser_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
```

Also make sure you are able to clone all your repositories in a non-interactive way. Just configure ssh-key and add the remote VCS to your known hosts.

Then download [the latest Rabbit binary.](https://github.com/Clivern/Rabbit/releases)

```bash
$ curl -sL https://github.com/Clivern/Rabbit/releases/download/x.x.x/rabbit_x.x.x_OS.tar.gz | tar xz
```

Create your config file as explained before on development part and run rabbit with systemd or anything else you prefer.

```
$ ./rabbit -config=/custom/path/config.prod.yml
```

### On Docker

Running rabbit with `docker-compose` is pretty straightforward.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Clivern/Rabbit.git
$ cd Rabbit/deployments/docker
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Docker will mount you host server `~/.ssh` directory in order to be able to clone repositories that need ssh key. Please make sure it has the right permissions and also remote VCS added to known hosts. otherwise rabbit will stuck on git interactive clone.
